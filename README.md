#Angular T3

##WDI LA 7 & 8: Project 1 - Tic Tac Toe
Tic Tac Toe built using HTML5, CSS3, AngularJS on the front-end, and Firebase on the back-end.

## What you are playing
Angular T3 is a scalable, dynamic, and responsive version of Tic Tac Toe. The board is built to easily take in any number of tiles, forming a squared playing field, as well as length for a win condition. However, the sizes have been limited to three options for a smoother user experience. Normal consists of the regular 3x3 board, Hard is a 4x4 board that takes 4 connecting linear tiles to win, and Expert creates a 5x5 board, again taking 4 connecting tiles to win. The players are also able to click on the reset button, clearing the current board.
